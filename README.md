# Themify

A simple Windows theme pack creator.

It creates a theme pack from your photo collection and put them in slideshow for your desktop background.

You can double-click `Main.vbs` to start with a user-friendly way to create the theme pack, or run `Procedure.vbs` with the following command-line arguments:

```
Procedure.vbs <SourceFolder> <ThemeName> [OutputFile]
```

After some time a `.deskthemepack` file will appear in the specified place.
